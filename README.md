# Grassroots Al-Quds Website Map

We made this map to help visitors explore Jerusalem, enjoy its beauty and get to know its past and present. We have included tips on things to see, and places to visit to support Palestinian businesses, as well as some information about the city's history and political context. Click on any point or polygon to start exploring! Our data comes from mapping workshops with Palestinian communities, other Palestinian organisations, international institutions and historical research: you can find details about our sources below.

## Data sources

We collected the information about places to visit (landmarks, hotels, restaurants and cafes) and organisations through workshops with Palestinian communities in Jerusalem and secondary research.

Data about Palestinian uprooted communities comes from these books:

* [All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948](https://www.palestine-studies.org/en/node/1649445), by Walid al-Khalidi
* [Biladuna Filastin (Palestine, Our Homeland)](https://www.palestine-studies.org/en/node/1648296), by Mustafa Murad al-Dabbagh
* [Jerusalem 1948: The Arab Neighbourhoods and their Fate in the War](https://www.palestine-studies.org/en/node/1649524), by Salim Tamari

The layers with the wall and checkpoints are from from [UNOCHA](https://www.un.org/geospatial/).

Data about Jerusalem's national parks is from [Ir Amin](https://www.ir-amim.org.il/en).

We produced the layer with the Palestinian communities under British Colonial Rule by digitizing the map *Palestine: Index of Villages and Settlements*, published by the Palestine Arab Refugee Office (New York) and based on the Palestine Survey and taxation record.
